## About Us

The mission of the Tazama is to develop and maintain an open source fraud detection mechanism for instant payment systems, in order to improve the safety of using those systems, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable customers that those systems serve.

Tazama is an open source software (OSS) real-time <<-insert your use case here->> monitoring solution. In its initial incarnation Tazama is focused on transaction monitoring for the detection of Fraud and Money Laundering behaviour. That's right: an **Open Source** transaction monitoring solution.

We built an open source product so that it can be used to promote trust in digital payments systems and encourage previously under-serviced communities to participate in digital payments ecosystems without worrying about the safety of their money. The product was envisaged by the [Level One Project](https://www.leveloneproject.org/), an initiative of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

While Tazama has strong applications in the financial services industry, it can also be used in other ways. The system could ingest any kind of data in real-time and model behaviour over time based on rules and scenarios specific to that data. Tazama could have applications in Healthcare Monitoring, Cybersecurity, Supply Chain Management, Smart City Applications, Retail and Customer Behavior Analysis, Transportation and Logistics, Environmental Monitoring, Telecommunications, IoT Devices and Smart Environments. (We asked ChatGPT.)

We are privileged, and very excited, to have recently joined The Linux Foundation as one of their many excellent Projects.
