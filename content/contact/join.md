# Join the Tazama Project Committees: A Call to Action

At Tazama, we have several groups that are open for you to join and meet with other collaborators.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

Dive into the heart of innovation with the Tazama Project by joining the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). This is where the magic happens: a space for those passionate about leveraging technology to create a safer, more transparent world for instant payment systems. As a member of the TSC, you're not just contributing to software; you're shaping the future of financial safety for the most vulnerable. Whether you're a developer, a tech enthusiast, or someone who believes in using their skills for good, the TSC is your platform to make a tangible difference. By steering the project's technical direction, you'll be at the forefront of developing open-source solutions that aim to curb fraud and enhance security for millions worldwide.

## End User Committee (EUC)

The End User Committee (EUC) offers a unique opportunity for those who stand at the crossroads of technology and its real-world application. If you represent a national bank, a fintech company, or a regulatory body—especially from countries striving towards financial inclusion—your insight is invaluable here. The EUC is not just about feedback; it's about shaping technology to meet the pressing needs of those it serves. Joining the EUC means you are directly contributing to the refinement and relevance of the Tazama Project, ensuring that the solutions developed are not just innovative but truly transformative for the end users, particularly in the world's least developed regions.

## Charitable Committee

The Charitable Committee is where empathy meets action. This committee is a beacon for organizations, nonprofits, and individuals dedicated to leveraging technology for charitable purposes. By joining, you become part of a compassionate community focused on using the Tazama Project to protect and empower the most vulnerable in society. Your insights and contributions will help guide the project to ensure it remains aligned with its core mission of social good, pushing the boundaries of what technology can do for humanity. Whether you're part of a charitable organization, a government agency, or simply someone who believes in the power of tech for good, your voice can help shape initiatives that change lives.

## Why Join?

In a world clamoring for equitable technological advancements, the Tazama Project stands as a testament to what collective action can achieve. Each committee offers a unique pathway to contribute to a project with the noble aim of safeguarding instant payment systems against fraud, especially for the world's most vulnerable populations. Whether you're drawn to the technical innovation of the TSC, the real-world impact of the EUC, the philanthropic vision of the Charitable Committee, or the governance and integrity upheld by the Standards Body, your participation is a step towards a future where technology serves everyone, everywhere, with fairness and security.
