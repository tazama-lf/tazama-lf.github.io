# Tazama Gains Prestigious Recognition as a Digital Public Good from the Digital Public Goods Alliance. 
9 September,2024

[The Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) is a multi-stakeholder initiative endorsed by the United Nations Secretary-General, working to accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods. 

The mission of Tazama to develop and maintain an open source fraud detection mechanism for instant payment systems, in order to improve the safety of using those systems, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable customers that those systems serve, was approved as a Digital Public Good under "SDG8: Decent Work and Economic Growth" and "SDG16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions".
